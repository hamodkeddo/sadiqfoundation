          <h2>Bakery restoration — Qaboun &amp; beyond</h2>
          <p>
            Syria needs 160 bakeries. Our first project launches in Qaboun, aiming to restore missing
            bakeries across the country. The goal is straightforward: provide bread, create jobs,
            and rebuild hope—bringing dignity back to our people one bakery at a time.
